/*
    The class progressbar is used to fix an issue with DXC react component DxcProgressBar.
    The width of the property value is too small for the progress bar width we are giving the component.
    The width percentages for progress bar originally were 5% for value and 90% for label,
    now they are changed to 15% for value and 90% for label.
